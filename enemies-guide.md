## High Forgemaster Tharûm Blackmantle

_Duergar Warlord / Artificer / Warlock_

Tharûm Blackmantle rose from the brutal politics of the Underdark, where survival depended not on strength, but on calculation. His clan was abandoned by its allies during a territorial collapse, teaching him a lesson he never forgot: morality is irrelevant without leverage. From that moment on, Tharûm devoted himself not to conquest, but to inevitability—learning siegecraft, logistics, and the economics of war until domination became a matter of planning rather than chance.

Amn was chosen not out of hatred, but efficiency. Its wealth, guilds, and trade networks make it the perfect engine for continental conquest. Through enslaved elementals, bound fiends, and shadow-forged engines, Tharûm wages war as an industry, believing resistance only prolongs suffering. He does not seek glory or loyalty—only stability enforced by overwhelming advantage.

## The Warmagus of the Coastal Keep

_Conclave Archmage / Strategic Commander_

Once a respected Amnian arcane scholar, the Warmagus specialized in long-range communication and battlefield coordination. When Athkatla fell, they chose not to flee, believing resistance would only fracture the realm further. Instead, they offered their expertise to the Iron Conclave, convinced that a swift, orderly conquest would spare the greatest number of lives.

From the Coastal Keep, the Warmagus maintains the arcane relay linking Athkatla to the eastern armies—synchronizing ground, air, and siege forces with ruthless precision. Knowing they are a single point of failure, they developed a forbidden contingency: fracturing their consciousness into multiple autonomous arcane aspects. To the Warmagus, this is not madness, but responsibility—command divided so it cannot be destroyed in a single blow.

## The Iron Conclave — Faction Breakdown

### The Blackmantle Duergar

_Architects of the War Machine_

- Elite duergar clans bound directly to Tharûm Blackmantle by oath, contract, or pact
- Serve as engineers, logisticians, overseers, and commanders
- View war as an industrial process to be optimized, not a struggle to be glorified
- Favor:
  - Siege engines powered by enslaved fire elementals
  - Shadow-forged weapons and armor
  - Rigid formations and overlapping fields of fire
- Enslave conquered populations for labor, not cruelty—waste is considered failure
- Believe surface realms are decadent, inefficient, and unworthy of autonomy
- Speak openly of Amn as a “resource basin,” not a kingdom

**Common Duergar Roles**

- Forge-priests and war-artificers
- Siege overseers and battery commanders
- Intelligence officers managing scouts, messengers, and arcane relays

### The Orc War-Clans of the Iron Conclave

_The Hammer Behind the Anvil_

- A coalition of orc clans shattered by years of internecine warfare
- United under Tharûm through conquest, coercion, and promised plunder
- Serve as shock troops, vanguard forces, and occupation enforcers
- Favor:
  - Brutal frontal assaults
  - Boarding actions and beach charges
  - Overwhelming numbers and relentless pressure
- Given freedom to fight as they wish—so long as objectives are met
- Conditioned to believe that service to the Conclave leads to endless war and spoils
- Many are unaware they are considered expendable by duergar leadership

**Common Orc Roles**

- Heavy shock units and berserkers
- Aerial beast riders and boarding parties

### Tharûm’s Control Over Both

- Duergar are bound by contracts, doctrine, and ideology
- Orcs are bound by fear, momentum, and reward
- Neither faction trusts the other—but both fear Tharûm’s reprisal
- The Coastal Keep exists primarily to ensure:
  - Orc aggression is properly directed
  - Duergar command is never isolated
  - Neither side can rebel without being crushed by the other
