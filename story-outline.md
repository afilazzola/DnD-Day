## SETTING

**Location:** The Sword Coast  
**Primary Objective:** The coastal region of the **Kingdom of Amn**

The Kingdom of Amn—one of the wealthiest powers on the Sword Coast—has fallen.

Its capital city, **Athkatla**, has been enslaved by **High Forgemaster Tharûm Blackmantle** and his Iron Conclave. Massive armies now guard every land approach into the kingdom, forming an impenetrable wall of steel, siegecraft, and merciless discipline.

The coastline, however—though heavily fortified—remains the only viable weakness. It is the fastest route inland, and the only path that can bypass the Conclave’s land armies before they fully mobilize.

This vulnerability has drawn a desperate gamble:  
**a full-scale amphibious invasion.**

---

## THE TRUE OBJECTIVE

The goal of _DnD Day_ is not to reclaim Amn in a single battle.

The goal is to **capture the Coastal Keep**.

The Coastal Keep is:

- A fortress
- A command hub
- The primary logistical and arcane relay between **Athkatla** and the Iron Conclave’s eastern armies

If the Keep falls:

- Eastern armies are cut off from command
- Reinforcements cannot be coordinated
- Battlefield intelligence collapses
- Athkatla becomes exposed

If the Keep holds:

- The invasion will be crushed between converging armies
- The Iron Conclave will respond with forces too vast to resist

The adventurers do not need to win the war today.  
**They only need to break it.**

---

## THE ENEMY: THE IRON CONCLAVE

A militarized alliance of **Duergar (Dark Dwarves)** and **Orc War-Clans**, united under a single, merciless doctrine.

### Why This Works Canonically

- Duergar are lawful, disciplined, cruel, and technologically inclined
- Orcs provide overwhelming numbers, brutality, and shock troops
- Their alliance is rare, unnatural, and deeply alarming to the wider world

This is not a raiding force.  
**This is an occupation.**

---

### Leadership

**High Forgemaster Tharûm Blackmantle**  
_Duergar Warlord / Artificer / Warlock_

- Seeks to rule one of the wealthiest kingdoms on the Sword Coast
- Intends to leverage Amn’s finances, guilds, and trade routes to fund continental conquest
- Employs enslaved fire elementals, bound fiends, and shadow-forged engines as battlefield artillery
- Believes resistance is futile—this invasion is merely the opening phase of inevitable domination

---

### Enemy Theme

- Industrialized war
- Ruthless efficiency
- Rigid command structures
- War as a machine, not a crusade

---

## THE THREAT

The Iron Conclave intends to:

1. Hold the coastline long enough to mobilize inland armies
2. Maintain the Coastal Keep’s communications with Athkatla
3. Crush the invasion through coordination and attrition

The adventurers must strike fast.

If the invasion stalls—even briefly—the Conclave’s response will be overwhelming.

This is not a battle for glory.  
**It is a race against consolidation.**

---

# ACT I — THE EVE OF WAR

### _Velen, Dragon’s Head Peninsula_

**Tone:** Tense, anticipatory, grim camaraderie

---

## ACT I SETTING

The adventurers have gathered in **Velen**, a fortified coastal town at the tip of the Dragon’s Head Peninsula. Once a bustling port town supporting Amnian trade, Velen now serves as the final staging ground for the invasion.

The town is overcrowded and strained:

- Docks packed with rowboats, transport barges, and hastily reinforced vessels
- Soldiers and mercenaries sleeping in streets and taverns
- Signal towers manned day and night
- The sea watched constantly for signs of movement

Across the water, somewhere beyond the horizon, the Iron Conclave waits.

---

## PURPOSE OF ACT I

Act I is not about action—it is about **weight**.

This act should:

- Let players prepare mechanically (gear, spells, consumables)
- Let players prepare emotionally (farewells, vows, fear)
- Establish the scale of the invasion
- Make it clear that not everyone here will survive

Players should feel like they are part of something massive—  
but still small in the face of what’s coming.

---

## POSSIBLE ELEMENTS IN VELEN

### Preparation & Logistics

- Quartermasters selling potions, scrolls, alchemical fire, climbing gear, and anti-air weapons
- Armorers reinforcing shields and weapons for coastal assault
- Spellcasters pooling spell components for battlefield magic

### Faith & Resolve

- Clerics and paladins offering blessings, last rites, or battlefield charms
- Shrines filled with soldiers making quiet prayers
- Confessions from NPCs who expect not to return

### Intelligence & Rumors

Scouts reporting:

- Enemy fortifications along the beaches — a wall of iron and stone the scouts call the "Amnian Wall"
- Wyverns and flying patrols circling offshore
- Fires burning along occupied coastlines

Conflicting rumors about the Iron Conclave’s true plans.

### Human Moments

- NPCs asking players to deliver messages “if I don’t make it”
- Veterans offering grim advice
- Fresh recruits hiding fear behind bravado

These NPCs may reappear wounded, missing, or dead during Acts II, III, and IV.

---

## KEY EVENTS

### 1. Final Preparations

Players are given limited time to:

- Spend gold
- Trade supplies
- Finalize plans
- Say goodbyes

**Once the invasion begins, there is no returning to Velen.**

---

### 2. The War Council

All adventurers gather—physically or narratively—to hear the overarching plan.

The briefing should:

- Outline the goal: seize the coast quickly
- Emphasize speed over total victory
- Explain that forces will be split into separate theaters
- Make clear that success in one area affects all others

This is where the adventurers are named collectively  
(e.g., _The Sword Coast Expeditionary Force_, _The Golden Host_).

---

### 3. Deployment

As dawn approaches:

- Beach assault teams board landing craft
- Air units prepare mounts, spellcraft, or vessels
- Infiltration forces ready teleportation circles or covert transport

Horns sound across Velen. Signal fires ignite along the cliffs.

**The sea is no longer empty.**

---

# ACT II — THE IRON TIDE

### _The Invasion_

**Tone:** Chaotic, heroic, overwhelming

The heroes are split into four theaters of war, each critical to the battle.

### Theater Themes

- Beach Landing (General Assault)
- Beach Landing (Siege Train)
- Portals & Bridges (Behind Enemy Lines)
- Air Battle (Sky Control)

---

## THEATER 1 — IRON WOLVES — BEACH LANDING (GENERAL ASSAULT)

**Role:** Shock force and distraction
**Tone:** Brutal, relentless, high casualties

### Act II — Storm the Beach

- Break shoreline defenses and push inland
- Engage enemy forces directly
- Draw the bulk of the Iron Conclave's attention
- Reach the road toward the Orn River

### Act III — Break the Line

- Breach fortified enemy positions between the beach and the river
- Clear the road for the siege train following behind
- Link up with portal team at the Pegasus Bridge

### Secondary Objectives (Optional)

- Destroy barricades
- Kill or rout commanders
- Capture signal towers

### Success Effects

- Enemy reinforcements delayed
- Siege Train faces lighter resistance
- Road to the bridge cleared

### Failure Effects

- Enemy pressure increases everywhere
- Siege Train bogged down

---

## THEATER 2 — STONE BREAKERS — BEACH LANDING (SIEGE TRAIN)

**Role:** Strategic enablers

### Act III — Climb the Bluffs

- Haul massive siege engines up the sandy bluffs
- Get creative — winches, magic, beasts of burden, or brute force
- Protect the equipment from saboteurs while vulnerable
- Cross the Pegasus Bridge and advance to the Keep

### Key Tension

The siege engines are slow and vulnerable. Getting them up the sandy terrain requires ingenuity. Losing them is catastrophic.

### Failure Effects

- Keep becomes nearly impregnable
- Act IV shifts toward attrition or sabotage
- Casualties spike dramatically

---

- Siege engines cannot reach the Keep
- Enemy has time to fortify the Coastal Keep

---

## THEATER 4 — STORM RIDERS — AIR BATTLE (SKY CONTROL)

**Role:** Air superiority
**Tone:** Fast, dangerous, cinematic

### Act II — Win the Sky

- Achieve air superiority over landing zones
- Intercept wyvern cavalry and gyrocopter bombers
- Neutralize war-mage spellcasters
- Protect ground forces from aerial bombardment

### Act III — Block the Road

- Land on the inland road beyond the Pegasus Bridge
- Establish a blocking position against Keep reinforcements
- Hold the road until beach forces break through
- Prevent enemy counterattack from reaching the bridge

### Success Effects

- Ground forces protected from air strikes
- Bridge isolated from Keep reinforcements
- Enemy command and control disrupted

### Failure Effects

## HOW IT ALL CONNECTS

| Theater | Company        | Act II Role           | Act III Role              | If They Fail           |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| T1      | Iron Wolves    | Storm the beach       | Break through to bridge   | Siege Train trapped    |
| T2      | Stone Breakers | Land the engines      | Climb the bluffs          | Keep impregnable       |
| T3      | Shadow Company | Infiltrate            | Disarm the bridge         | Bridge destroyed       |
| T4      | Storm Riders   | Win the sky           | Block reinforcements      | Portal team overwhelmed|

**No theater stands alone.**

All four theaters converge on Pegasus Bridge in Act III. Shadow Company disarms it, Storm Riders block reinforcements, and the Iron Wolves and Stone Breakers break through to link up.

---

## GLOBAL ESCALATION SIGNS (NO CLOCK)

Escalations occur only if theaters fail:

- Messengers attempt to break through
- Signal flares erupt from the Keep
- Arcane beacons pulse brighter
- Air units converge on the fortress

---

# ACT III — THE BRIDGE

### _The Orn River Crossing_

**Tone:** Tense, desperate, against the clock

---

## THE CRITICAL CROSSING

Between the beaches and the Coastal Keep lies **Pegasus Bridge** over the Orn River — the only crossing capable of supporting siege engines and massed troops.

Intelligence confirms the Iron Conclave has rigged it for demolition.

If the bridge falls:

- Siege engines cannot cross the river
- Ground forces must find alternate routes through enemy territory
- The Coastal Keep has time to reinforce
- The invasion stalls

**The bridge must hold. Everything depends on it.**

---

## FOUR THEATERS, ONE OBJECTIVE

All four theaters converge on Pegasus Bridge. Each has a critical role.

---

### THEATER 1 — IRON WOLVES — BREAK THE LINE

**Role:** Punch through to the bridge
**Tone:** Brutal, relentless push

The assault force must smash through the entrenched enemy defensive line blocking the road to the river.

**Objectives:**

- Breach fortified enemy positions between the beach and the river
- Clear the road for the siege train following behind
- Link up with the portal team at the bridge

**Key Tension:** Speed matters. The longer they take, the more pressure on the bridge defenders.

---

### THEATER 2 — STONE BREAKERS — CLIMB THE BLUFFS

**Role:** Get the siege engines through
**Tone:** Problem-solving under fire

The siege train faces a brutal challenge: hauling massive catapults and trebuchets up the sandy bluffs of Hoc's Point and through difficult terrain while under fire.

**Objectives:**

- Haul siege engines up the sandy bluffs
- Get creative — winches, magic, beasts of burden, brute force, or improvised solutions
- Protect the equipment from saboteurs while vulnerable
- Cross the bridge and advance to the Keep

**Key Tension:** The siege engines are slow and vulnerable. Losing them is catastrophic for Act IV.

---

### THEATER 3 — SHADOW COMPANY — DISARM THE BRIDGE

**Role:** The tip of the spear
**Tone:** Surgical, desperate, isolated

The portal team is already behind enemy lines — the only force close enough to reach the bridge before the demolition order is given.

**Objectives:**

- Assault the Duergar demolition platoon holding the bridge
- Neutralize sappers before they trigger the charges
- Disarm or destroy the explosive runes and barrels
- Hold the bridge until reinforcements arrive

**Key Tension:** They are outnumbered and isolated. If they fail, the invasion stalls.

---

### THEATER 4 — STORM RIDERS — BLOCK THE ROAD

**Role:** Cut off reinforcements
**Tone:** Fast transition from air to ground combat

With air superiority achieved, flying units must land on the road beyond the bridge to intercept enemy reinforcements marching from the Coastal Keep.

**Objectives:**

- Land on the inland road past the bridge
- Establish a blocking position against Keep reinforcements
- Buy time for the portal team and beach forces
- Prevent enemy counterattack from reaching the bridge

**Key Tension:** They're trading mobility for position. Once grounded, they must hold.

---

## ACT III OUTCOMES

### If the Bridge Holds

- Siege engines cross and advance toward the Keep
- All ground forces converge and link up
- The final assault begins with momentum
- Enemy forces at the Keep are isolated

### If the Bridge Falls

- Siege equipment cannot reach the Keep
- Ground forces must find alternate crossings through enemy territory
- The Keep has time to reinforce
- Act IV becomes significantly harder — or impossible

---

# ACT IV — THE FALL OF THE COASTAL KEEP

**Tone:** Desperate, mythic, decisive

All surviving forces converge on the Coastal Keep.

---

## THE TWIST: THE ARCANE COMMANDER

The Keep is commanded by a **Conclave Warmagus**, responsible for:

- Battlefield coordination
- Arcane relay with Athkatla
- Synchronization of ground and air forces

As the assault begins, the Warmagus reveals a final contingency.

---

## THE SPLINTERING OF THE MIND

The Warmagus fractures into **four arcane aspects**, each tied to a theater of war.

Each splinter:

- Represents a facet of command (Control, Destruction, Deception, Dominion)
- Manifests near or within one theater
- Must be defeated independently

**Victory is collective.**

---

## THE FINAL MOMENT

Once all splinters—or a decisive majority—are destroyed:

- Arcane relays collapse
- Signal beacons fail
- Orders from Athkatla cease
- Enemy formations fragment

The Iron Conclave has not been destroyed—  
**but its grip on Amn has been broken.**

---

## OPTIONAL EPILOGUE

DMs pause simultaneously.

The Lead DM delivers a unified epilogue:

- The fate of the Coastal Keep
- The shock in Athkatla
- The beginning of open rebellion across Amn
